Disgord Plugins
====

Dis**go**rd is an easy to use and extensible Discord Bot using the [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library.

Files in this folder are easy to use plugins for Disgord. To enable use
of one of these plugins just copy them into the same folder as your Disgord 
main.go or use symbolic links then recompile Disgord.  That's it.

**NOTE** As you probably can see this folder is pretty empty! But, plugins
are on their way.
