Disgord Extra's
====

Dis**go**rd is a Discord Bot wrote in Google [Go](https://golang.org/) using the [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) package.

Files in this folder are like easy to use plugins for Disgord. To enable use
of one of these plugins just copy them into the same folder as your Disgord 
main.go or use symbolic links then recompile Disgord.  That's it.

**NOTE** As you probably can see this folder is pretty empty! But, plugins
are on their way.
